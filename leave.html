        <h2>Clinical Students:</h2>

        <p> Absences during the clinical years are likely to have a more serious impact on your learning than absences during pre clinical teaching. There may also be particular weeks/days where it is your only opportunity to receive teaching/experience in particular specialties. If your absence is not on health grounds or for a critical personal problem you should take this into consideration.</p>

        <p>Please note that if you take a long period of leave during a Unit, and then also have to take time off for illness, you may fail the Unit due to non attendance.</p>

        <p>Requests for leave during external SSC Units: SSC Co-ordinator – via Year 3 or 5 Year Co-ordinator at Bristol.</p>

        <p>Requests for leave during any other teaching: Programme Director via relevant Year Co-ordinator at Bristol. </p>

        <p>Please note leave of 4 days and over will need to be countersigned by the Programme Director Student Affairs, please allow time for this to happen.</p>


        <p>The Programme Directors (Student Affairs) will follow-up on the welfare of any student who has had substantial time off.  If you are refused a leave of absence you may ‘appeal’ to the Academy Dean via your Year Co-ordinator at the Centre for Medical Education.</p>

        <p>Evidence may be requested particularly for longer leave requests or if you have already had long periods of absence. </p>
